# Minesweeper

Relive your greatest childhood memory with this classic puzzle game.

## How to Play

Reveal squares of the grid by clicking or tapping on them. If a square containing a mine is revealed, the player loses the game. If no mine is revealed, a digit is displayed in the square, indicating how many adjacent squares contain mines; using this information, the player can proceed to reveal additional squares. The game is won when all mine-free squares are revealed.

### Controls

- **Left Click**: Reveals what is under the square.
- **Right Click**: Places a flag on a square to indicate a suspected mine.
